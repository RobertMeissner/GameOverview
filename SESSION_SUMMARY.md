# GameOverview Migration to Cloudflare Workers - Session Summary

## What We Accomplished

### 1. Initial Setup
- Confirmed we're on the main branch
- Discussed deploying frontend to Cloudflare Workers instead of Pages

### 2. Created Cloudflare Worker for Steam API
- Created `workers/steam-api/` directory
- Implemented Steam API endpoint (`/games/add`) in JavaScript
- Successfully tested the Worker deployment
- Worker URL: `https://steam-api.your-subdomain.workers.dev`

### 3. Made URLs Configurable
- Added environment variables to `frontend/.env`:
  - `REACT_APP_STEAM_API_URL`
  - `REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL`
- Updated `AddDataItem.tsx` to use environment variables
- Created `.env.example` template

### 4. Migrated to Unified Worker Architecture
- Created new `worker/` directory structure
- Combined static asset serving + API endpoints in single Worker
- Created `worker/src/index.js` with:
  - Static file serving using `@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler`
  - API routes (`/api/games/add`)
  - SPA routing support
- Updated frontend to use relative API calls (`/api/games/add`)
- Created build process in `worker/package.json`
- Set up GitHub Actions workflow for automated deployment

### 5. Fixed Build Issues
- Resolved KV namespace configuration issues
- Created proper KV namespaces with IDs:
  - Production: `985c8479245f41d1ab8f0fffe5bec30f`
  - Preview: `00f0db0138804894821952e63035a3da`

### 6. Fixed ESLint Errors
- Removed unused variables (`dialogOpen`, `setDialogOpen`)
- Fixed strict equality operators (`!=` → `!==`)
- Added parentheses for operator precedence
- Removed unused imports (`Slider`, `Thumbnail`, `StoreURL`)
- Added missing Babel dependency

### 7. Fixed Build Process
- Updated `copy:assets` script to create `static/` directory
- Added `static/` to `.gitignore` (build artifacts shouldn't be committed)

### 8. GitHub Actions Issues (Resolved)
- Deployment fails due to missing `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
- Issue: Token was added to Environment secrets instead of Repository secrets
- **Solution**: Move token to Repository secrets in GitHub Settings

### 9. Fixed "Not Found" Issue on Production
- **Problem**: Preview URL https://nextbestgame.robertforpresent.workers.dev/ showed "not found"
- **Root Cause**: Using legacy `[site]` configuration with `@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler` but assets weren't uploading to KV namespace
- **Investigation Process**:
  1. Confirmed Worker was deploying successfully
  2. Added debug endpoints to verify API functionality
  3. Discovered `getAssetFromKV` was failing with "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'url')"
  4. Fixed function call syntax but still got "could not find index.html in your content namespace"
  5. Checked KV namespaces - all were empty despite successful deployments
- **Solution**: Migrated from legacy `[site]` to modern `[assets]` configuration
  - Changed `wrangler.toml`: `[site] bucket = "./static"` → `[assets] directory = "./static"`
  - Updated Worker code: `getAssetFromKV()` → `env.ASSETS.fetch()`
  - Removed dependency on `@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler`
- **Result**: Assets now upload properly (10 files uploaded) and site works correctly

## Current Status
- ✅ Local builds work successfully
- ✅ Worker code is ready for deployment
- ✅ All ESLint issues resolved
- ✅ GitHub Actions deployment working
- ✅ Production site working at https://nextbestgame.robertforpresent.workers.dev/

## Key Learnings
1. **Cloudflare Workers Assets Evolution**: The `[site]` configuration with KV asset handler is legacy. Modern Workers should use `[assets]` with `env.ASSETS.fetch()`
2. **Debugging Strategy**: When assets fail to serve, check if they're actually being uploaded to the storage backend (KV vs Assets)
3. **Wrangler Version Matters**: Wrangler v4 has better support for the modern assets API
4. **Asset Upload Verification**: Look for "Uploaded X files" in deployment logs to confirm assets are being processed

## Key Files Created/Modified
- `worker/src/index.js` - Unified Worker code (updated to use modern Assets API)
- `worker/wrangler.toml` - Worker configuration (migrated from `[site]` to `[assets]`)
- `worker/package.json` - Build scripts
- `.github/workflows/deploy-worker.yml` - Deployment automation
- `frontend/.env` - Environment configuration
- Various ESLint fixes in React components
- `SESSION_SUMMARY.md` - Updated with debugging findings and solutions
