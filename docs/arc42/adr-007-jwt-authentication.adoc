= ADR-007: JWT-Based Authentication with Cloudflare D1

**Status**: Implemented +
**Date**: 2025-01-04 +
**Deciders**: Development Team

== Context

The GameOverview application requires user authentication to provide personalized game libraries and user-specific data. The application runs on Cloudflare Workers, which has specific constraints around session management and database access.

=== Requirements
* Secure user authentication and authorization
* Stateless authentication suitable for serverless environment
* Support for both API token and cookie-based authentication
* Integration with Cloudflare D1 database
* Protection against common security vulnerabilities

=== Constraints
* Cloudflare Workers runtime limitations
* No traditional session storage available
* Must work with Web Crypto API (no Node.js crypto)
* Limited to Cloudflare D1 for data persistence

== Decision

We will implement JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication with the following architecture:

=== Authentication Flow
1. **Registration/Login**: Users provide credentials, receive JWT token
2. **Token Storage**: Dual approach - localStorage for SPA + HTTP-only cookies for security
3. **Request Authentication**: Support both Bearer tokens and cookie-based auth
4. **Token Validation**: Server-side JWT verification with Web Crypto API

=== Technical Implementation
* **Password Hashing**: SHA-256 using Web Crypto API
* **JWT Signing**: HMAC-SHA256 with configurable secret
* **Token Expiration**: 24-hour default with configurable duration
* **Database**: Cloudflare D1 with proper user isolation
* **CORS**: Configured for cross-origin requests with credentials

=== Security Measures
* HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS token theft
* Secure and SameSite cookie attributes
* Password minimum length requirements
* Email format validation
* Unique constraints on email and username
* Foreign key constraints for data integrity

== Consequences

=== Positive
* ✅ **Stateless**: Perfect for serverless/edge computing
* ✅ **Scalable**: No server-side session storage required
* ✅ **Secure**: Industry-standard JWT with proper security practices
* ✅ **Flexible**: Supports both API and web browser authentication
* ✅ **Fast**: Minimal database queries for authentication
* ✅ **Standards Compliant**: Uses Web Crypto API and standard JWT format

=== Negative
* ❌ **Token Revocation**: Cannot invalidate tokens before expiration
* ❌ **Token Size**: JWT tokens larger than session IDs
* ❌ **Crypto Limitations**: Limited to Web Crypto API algorithms
* ❌ **Secret Management**: JWT secret must be securely managed

=== Mitigations
* Short token expiration times (24h) limit exposure window
* Refresh token mechanism can be added for longer sessions
* Environment variable management for JWT secrets
* Monitoring and alerting for authentication failures

== Implementation Details

=== Database Schema
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    email TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    password_hash TEXT NOT NULL,
    username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);
```

=== API Endpoints
* `POST /api/auth/register` - User registration
* `POST /api/auth/login` - User login
* `POST /api/auth/logout` - User logout (cookie clearing)
* `GET /api/auth/me` - Get current user info

=== Frontend Integration
* React Context for global auth state
* Axios interceptors for automatic token handling
* Protected route components
* Automatic token refresh on API errors

== Alternatives Considered

=== Session-Based Authentication
**Rejected**: Requires server-side session storage, not suitable for Cloudflare Workers

=== OAuth/OIDC Integration
**Deferred**: Adds complexity and external dependencies, can be added later

=== Magic Link Authentication
**Deferred**: Requires email service integration, more complex implementation

=== API Key Authentication
**Rejected**: Less secure for user-facing applications, no user context
