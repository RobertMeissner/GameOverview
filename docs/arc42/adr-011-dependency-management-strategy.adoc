= ADR-011: Dependency Management Strategy

== Status

Implemented

== Context

The GameOverview project had accumulated significant dependency bloat over time, with numerous unused packages that were:

* **Increasing bundle size** and build times unnecessarily
* **Creating security vulnerabilities** through unused but outdated packages
* **Complicating dependency management** with potential version conflicts
* **Reducing developer productivity** with slower installs and builds
* **Masking real dependencies** in the noise of unused packages

Analysis revealed:
* **Frontend**: 24+ unused dependencies including legacy data processing libraries (parquetjs, ajv), unused UI libraries (react-table), and Node.js polyfills (buffer, util, assert)
* **Worker**: Unused testing infrastructure (vitest-environment-miniflare) and legacy asset handlers
* **Mixed usage**: Some dependencies appeared unused but were actually required by build tools or had indirect usage

The project needed a systematic approach to dependency management that would:
* Remove genuinely unused dependencies safely
* Establish criteria for future dependency additions
* Maintain build tool requirements and indirect dependencies
* Provide a process for regular dependency auditing

== Decision

We will implement a systematic dependency management strategy with clear criteria and regular auditing:

=== Dependency Classification System
* **Core Dependencies**: Essential for application functionality (React, axios, Material-UI)
* **Build Dependencies**: Required by build tools even if not directly imported (TypeScript, Babel plugins)
* **Development Dependencies**: Testing, linting, and development tools (Vitest, testing libraries)
* **Legacy Dependencies**: Outdated packages that should be removed or replaced

=== Removal Criteria
Dependencies will be removed if they meet ALL of the following:
1. **No direct imports** found in source code via static analysis
2. **No build tool requirements** (not referenced in package.json scripts or config files)
3. **No peer dependency requirements** from other packages
4. **No runtime polyfills** required for target environments

=== Retention Criteria
Dependencies will be retained if they meet ANY of the following:
1. **Direct source code usage** found via grep/search
2. **Build script dependencies** referenced in package.json scripts
3. **Configuration requirements** needed by bundlers, test runners, or other tools
4. **Peer dependencies** required by other packages we use

=== Regular Auditing Process
* **Monthly dependency audits** using automated tools (depcheck, npm audit)
* **Pre-release dependency review** before major version releases
* **Security vulnerability monitoring** with immediate response for high-severity issues
* **Version update strategy** prioritizing security patches and bug fixes over feature updates

== Consequences

=== Positive
* ‚úÖ **Reduced Bundle Size**: Removed 24+ unused frontend dependencies, reducing install size
* ‚úÖ **Faster Builds**: Fewer dependencies to process during build and install
* ‚úÖ **Improved Security**: Eliminated unused packages that could introduce vulnerabilities
* ‚úÖ **Cleaner Dependencies**: package.json files now clearly show actual project requirements
* ‚úÖ **Better Maintainability**: Easier to understand and manage actual dependencies
* ‚úÖ **Reduced Conflicts**: Fewer packages means fewer potential version conflicts

=== Negative
* ‚ùå **Initial Effort**: Required careful analysis to avoid removing required dependencies
* ‚ùå **Risk of Breakage**: Potential for removing dependencies that have indirect usage
* ‚ùå **Ongoing Maintenance**: Requires regular auditing to prevent future bloat

=== Neutral
* üîÑ **Functionality Preserved**: All application features continue to work as expected
* üîÑ **Development Workflow**: No changes to day-to-day development processes

== Implementation Details

=== Dependencies Removed

==== Frontend (24+ packages)
```bash
# Data processing libraries (legacy from previous architecture)
ajv ajv-keywords parquetjs parquetjs-lite

# Node.js polyfills (not needed in modern React)
assert buffer util readable-stream

# Unused UI libraries
react-table

# Babel plugins (removed then reinstalled as actually required)
@babel/plugin-proposal-private-property-in-object
```

==== Worker (1 package)
```bash
# Testing infrastructure not actually used
vitest-environment-miniflare
```

=== Dependencies Retained (Despite appearing unused)
* **wrangler**: Used in package.json scripts for deployment
* **typescript**: Required for TypeScript compilation even if not directly imported
* **@vitest/coverage-v8**: Used by vitest --coverage command
* **@cloudflare/kv-asset-handler**: May be used in future asset handling (kept for now)

=== Auditing Tools Used
```bash
# Primary tool for unused dependency detection
npx depcheck --skip-missing

# Security vulnerability scanning
npm audit

# Manual verification
grep -r "package-name" src/
```

=== Process Documentation
1. **Run depcheck** to identify potentially unused dependencies
2. **Manual verification** using grep to search for actual usage
3. **Check package.json scripts** for build tool requirements
4. **Review configuration files** for indirect dependencies
5. **Test removal** in isolated branch before committing
6. **Verify all tests pass** after dependency removal

== Alternatives Considered

=== Keep All Dependencies "Just in Case"
* **Rejected**: Continues to accumulate technical debt and security vulnerabilities
* **Risk**: Bundle bloat and potential conflicts as dependencies become more outdated

=== Aggressive Removal Without Analysis
* **Rejected**: High risk of breaking builds or functionality
* **Risk**: Could remove dependencies that have indirect or build-time requirements

=== Automated Dependency Management Tools
* **Considered**: Tools like Renovate or Dependabot for automatic updates
* **Deferred**: Will implement after establishing baseline with manual process
* **Future**: May adopt automated tools for ongoing maintenance

== Related ADRs

* ADR-010: Test Infrastructure Modernization - Established modern testing dependencies that this ADR maintains
* ADR-008: TypeScript Migration - TypeScript dependencies are core to the architecture
* ADR-006: Deployment Strategy - Wrangler and deployment dependencies are essential

== Notes

This ADR establishes a foundation for ongoing dependency hygiene. The initial cleanup removed obvious unused dependencies, but the real value is in the process and criteria established for future dependency management.

The decision to be conservative in removal (keeping dependencies when in doubt) reflects the principle that a working system with some extra dependencies is better than a broken system with minimal dependencies.

Future iterations of this process should consider:
* Automated dependency update tools
* Bundle size monitoring and alerts
* Dependency license compliance checking
* Regular security scanning integration
