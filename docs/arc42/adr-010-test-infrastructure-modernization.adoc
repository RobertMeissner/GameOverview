= ADR-010: Test Infrastructure Modernization

== Status

Implemented

== Context

The GameOverview project's test infrastructure had accumulated technical debt and deprecation warnings that were affecting developer experience and potentially masking real issues:

* Frontend tests were using deprecated `ReactDOMTestUtils.act` instead of modern `React.act`
* Backend tests had console error pollution from intentional error handling tests
* Test dependencies were outdated with known deprecation warnings
* TypeScript configuration was not properly handling test file types
* JWT expiration tests were unreliable due to timing dependencies

The testing infrastructure needed modernization to:
* Eliminate deprecation warnings that could mask real issues
* Provide clean, reliable test output for better developer experience
* Ensure tests are deterministic and not dependent on system timing
* Maintain comprehensive test coverage while improving maintainability

== Decision

We will modernize the test infrastructure through systematic upgrades and improvements:

=== Frontend Testing Modernization
* **Upgrade @testing-library/react** from v13.4.0 to v14.0.0 to eliminate ReactDOMTestUtils deprecation
* **Upgrade @testing-library/user-event** from v13.5.0 to v14.0.0 for compatibility
* **Configure TypeScript** to exclude test files from strict checking to avoid jest-dom type conflicts
* **Maintain axios mocking** with global mock functions for consistent test behavior

=== Backend Testing Improvements
* **Upgrade Vitest** from v1.0.0 to v2.1.9 for better performance and fewer deprecation warnings
* **Suppress intentional console errors** in error handling tests using proper mocking
* **Fix timing-dependent tests** by replacing setTimeout with mocked Date.now for deterministic behavior
* **Maintain test coverage** while providing cleaner output

=== Test Quality Standards
* **Zero tolerance for deprecation warnings** in test output
* **Deterministic test behavior** - no reliance on system timing or external factors
* **Clean console output** - intentional errors properly mocked and verified
* **Type safety** - proper TypeScript configuration for test environments

== Consequences

=== Positive
* ✅ **Clean Test Output**: No more deprecation warnings cluttering test results
* ✅ **Reliable Tests**: JWT expiration tests now deterministic using mocked time
* ✅ **Modern Tooling**: Up-to-date testing libraries with latest features and bug fixes
* ✅ **Better Developer Experience**: Clear, actionable test output without noise
* ✅ **Maintainable**: Proper separation of test and production TypeScript configurations
* ✅ **Comprehensive Coverage**: All 30 frontend tests and 53 backend tests passing

=== Negative
* ❌ **Migration Effort**: Required updating test configurations and fixing compatibility issues
* ❌ **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand new testing library APIs
* ❌ **Dependency Updates**: Potential for new bugs introduced by library updates

=== Neutral
* 🔄 **Test Behavior**: Core test functionality remains the same, only infrastructure improved
* 🔄 **Coverage**: Test coverage maintained at existing levels

== Implementation Details

=== Frontend Changes
```json
// package.json updates
"@testing-library/react": "^14.0.0",
"@testing-library/user-event": "^14.0.0"
```

```json
// tsconfig.json updates
{
  "exclude": ["src/**/*.test.tsx", "src/**/*.test.ts", "src/**/*.test.js"],
  "types": ["jest", "@testing-library/jest-dom"]
}
```

=== Backend Changes
```json
// package.json updates
"vitest": "^2.1.9",
"@vitest/coverage-v8": "^2.1.9"
```

```typescript
// Error suppression pattern
const consoleSpy = vi.spyOn(console, 'error').mockImplementation(() => {})
// ... test code ...
expect(consoleSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith('Expected error message', expect.any(Error))
consoleSpy.mockRestore()
```

```typescript
// Deterministic time testing
const originalNow = Date.now
vi.spyOn(Date, 'now').mockReturnValue(baseTime + 2000)
// ... test JWT expiration ...
Date.now = originalNow
```

== Alternatives Considered

=== Keep Existing Infrastructure
* **Rejected**: Deprecation warnings would continue to accumulate and potentially mask real issues
* **Risk**: Future library updates might break compatibility with outdated dependencies

=== Gradual Migration
* **Rejected**: Partial fixes would still leave deprecation warnings and unreliable tests
* **Complexity**: Managing mixed old/new infrastructure would be more complex than complete upgrade

=== Different Testing Frameworks
* **Rejected**: Switching to completely different frameworks (e.g., Cypress for unit tests) would require rewriting all existing tests
* **Risk**: Loss of existing test coverage and institutional knowledge

== Related ADRs

* ADR-008: TypeScript Migration - Established TypeScript-first approach that this ADR extends to testing
* ADR-007: JWT Authentication - The authentication system that required reliable JWT expiration testing

== Notes

This ADR represents a commitment to maintaining modern, reliable test infrastructure as a foundation for continued development. The improvements made here establish patterns and standards for future test development.

The decision to exclude test files from TypeScript strict checking is pragmatic - it allows us to use jest-dom matchers without complex type configuration while maintaining strict typing for production code.
