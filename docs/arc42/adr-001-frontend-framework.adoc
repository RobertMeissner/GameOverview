== Status
Accepted

== Context
The application requires a modern frontend framework for building the game overview dashboard with data visualization and filtering capabilities.

== Decision
We will use React with TypeScript for the frontend implementation.

== Rationale
Cloudflare requires Typescript. Python is in Beta.

== Consequences
=== Positive
* Component-based architecture
* Strong TypeScript support
* Large ecosystem of UI libraries

=== Negative
* Bundle size considerations
* Learning curve for team members
* No chance to learn Django
