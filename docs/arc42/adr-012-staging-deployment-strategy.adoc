= ADR-012: Staging Deployment Strategy

== Status

Accepted

== Context

The GameOverview project currently deploys directly to production on every push to the main branch. To improve development workflow and reduce production risks, we need a staging environment where changes can be tested before production deployment.

Key requirements:
- Easy to trigger staging deployments
- Isolated staging environment with separate resources
- Clear promotion path from staging to production
- Minimal complexity and maintenance overhead
- Support for testing new features before production release

== Decision Drivers

* **Developer Experience**: Should be easy to deploy to staging without complex procedures
* **Risk Mitigation**: Staging should catch issues before they reach production
* **Resource Management**: Staging resources should be separate but cost-effective
* **Automation**: Minimize manual steps while maintaining control
* **Rollback Capability**: Easy to revert staging deployments if needed
* **Integration**: Should work well with existing GitHub Actions workflow

== Considered Options

=== Option 1: Git Tag-Based Deployment
**Trigger**: Git tags with pattern `staging-*` or `v*-staging`

**Pros**:
- Explicit versioning and release control
- Easy rollback by referencing specific tags
- Clear audit trail of staging deployments
- Integrates well with semantic versioning
- No additional branch management

**Cons**:
- Requires manual tagging step
- Additional workflow complexity
- Developers need to remember tagging conventions

**Implementation**:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'staging-*'
      - 'v*-staging'
```

=== Option 2: Branch-Based Deployment
**Trigger**: Pushes to dedicated `staging` branch

**Pros**:
- Automatic deployment on push
- Clear separation of staging vs production code
- Familiar Git workflow
- Easy to see what's in staging

**Cons**:
- Branch management overhead
- Potential merge conflicts between staging and main
- Need to maintain separate branch
- Risk of staging branch diverging from main

**Implementation**:
```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main      # production
      - staging   # staging
```

=== Option 3: Workflow Dispatch with Environment Selection
**Trigger**: Manual GitHub Actions workflow dispatch

**Pros**:
- Maximum flexibility and control
- Single workflow for both environments
- On-demand deployment
- Can deploy any commit to staging

**Cons**:
- Manual process requiring GitHub UI access
- No automatic staging deployments
- Requires remembering to deploy to staging
- Less integrated with development workflow

**Implementation**:
```yaml
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      environment:
        description: 'Environment to deploy to'
        required: true
        default: 'staging'
        type: choice
        options:
          - staging
          - production
```

=== Option 4: Pull Request Preview Deployments
**Trigger**: Pull request creation/updates

**Pros**:
- Isolated testing per feature
- Automatic cleanup
- Great for code review
- No conflicts between features

**Cons**:
- Complex setup and resource management
- Higher costs (multiple environments)
- Requires dynamic environment creation
- Overkill for current project size

== Decision

**Chosen Option: Git Tag-Based Deployment (Option 1)**

=== Rationale

Git tag-based deployment provides the best balance of control, simplicity, and developer experience for our current needs:

1. **Explicit Control**: Developers can choose exactly when to deploy to staging by creating a tag
2. **Version Management**: Tags provide clear versioning and audit trail
3. **Rollback Capability**: Easy to redeploy previous versions by referencing tags
4. **No Branch Overhead**: Avoids the complexity of maintaining separate branches
5. **Flexible Timing**: Can deploy to staging at any point in development cycle
6. **Production Safety**: Staging deployments don't interfere with production workflow

=== Implementation Strategy

1. **Tag Convention**: Use `staging-YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM` or `v*-staging` patterns
2. **Separate Environments**: Staging uses separate Cloudflare resources
3. **Environment Variables**: Different configuration for staging vs production
4. **Database Isolation**: Separate D1 database for staging
5. **Automated Testing**: Run full test suite before staging deployment

== Consequences

=== Positive
- Clear separation between staging and production deployments
- Explicit versioning and release control
- Easy rollback and redeployment capabilities
- Minimal impact on existing production workflow
- Good developer experience with simple tagging

=== Negative
- Requires developers to remember tagging conventions
- Additional step in deployment process
- Need to manage separate staging resources
- Slightly more complex CI/CD configuration

=== Neutral
- Staging deployments are intentional rather than automatic
- Requires documentation of tagging conventions
- Need to monitor staging resource usage

== Implementation Plan

1. Create staging environment configuration in `wrangler.toml`
2. Set up separate Cloudflare resources (D1 database, KV namespace)
3. Update GitHub Actions workflow to handle tag-based deployments
4. Configure environment-specific variables
5. Document tagging conventions for developers
6. Test staging deployment process

== Monitoring and Review

- Monitor staging deployment frequency and success rate
- Gather developer feedback on tagging workflow
- Review staging resource costs monthly
- Evaluate promotion process from staging to production
- Consider automation improvements based on usage patterns
