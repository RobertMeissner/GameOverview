= ADR-004: Data Storage Strategy

== Status
Superseded by adr-007 and Cloudflare Choice.

== Context
The application needs to store and manage game data from multiple sources with different update frequencies.

== Decision
We will use file-based storage with structured data formats for game information.

== Rationale
Sufficient for local PoC

== Consequences
=== Positive
* Simple deployment and backup
* No database infrastructure required
* Version control friendly

=== Negative
* Limited query capabilities
* Scalability constraints
* Concurrent access limitations

== Notes
[Add any additional notes here]
