= ADR-013: Hosting on Cloudflare

**Date**: 2025-11-21 +

== Status
Accepted

== Context

Local-only hosting of the solution does not scale well. Also, database management requires additional step.
Cloudflare offers a fully managed and free (!) solution that fulfills all requirements.

== Decision

I will focus on Cloudflare for hosting. Docker, docker compose etc. are outdated.


== Rationale

Cloudflare requires Typescript. Python is in Beta and many packages are not available, e.g. pandas, numpy.

== Consequences
=== Positive

* Through wrangler I can deploy through CLI and run it locally
* Database connection and deployment stages have minimum overhead
* Free tier generous
* Reduced infrastructure complexity: no docker needed

=== Negative

* Vendor lock in
* SQLite lock-in locally
* Rewrite of python backend required

== Notes
